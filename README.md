# The Bible Decentralised
Decentralised Bible App using IPFS

This is a decentralised web-app (Dapp). The website can be uploaded using IPFS, which is a decentralised storage. So, there is no central server or hosting, but just different nodes who all serve a bit of this website. 

The website itself allso makes use of IPFS to load the different books of the Bible. The Bible books all have their own hashcode in IPFS, you can find the hashcodes in the js code. The Bible books are stored in JSON format. This way, everybody can make a website which loads those Bible Books. 

At this moment you need a local IPFS node to make this website work. This maybe sounds complicated, but isn't. Just install IPFS on Nodejs, then run "IPFS daemon". 

This website is just an example on how to load IPFS files using javascript. Use it to read the Bible (very interesting) or to learn to write decentralised apps.
