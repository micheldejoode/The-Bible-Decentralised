# The Bible Decentralised
Decentralised Bible App using IPFS

This is a decentralised web-app (Dapp). The website can be uploaded using IPFS, which is a decentralised storage. So, there is no central server or hosting, but just different nodes who all serve a bit of this website. 

The website itself allso makes use of IPFS to load the different books of the Bible. The Bible books all have their own hashcode in IPFS, you can find the hashcodes in the js code. The Bible books are stored in JSON format. This way, everybody can make a website which loads those Bible Books. 

## Install

1. Download the files from Github.
2. At this moment you need a local IPFS node to make this website work. See https://ipfs.io/docs/install/ for instructions.
3. Go to the command prompt or open a Node.js command prompt, then type `ipfs daemon`
4. Open index.html



That's it. 

This website is just an example on how to load IPFS files using javascript. Use it to read the Bible (very interesting) or to learn to write decentralised apps. Not all Bible books are available right now, more books will be added.
